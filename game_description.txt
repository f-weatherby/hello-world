Game Project Write Up




The idea of the “Smurf” game was to give it an adventurous feel where the users would enjoy the unknowns of the game all while collecting coins as rewards to feel like they are working towards something. We have a single and multiplayer option, the single starts with the tap of the space bar, and the user must click on the red box to activate the two player. Although the camera movement is a bit awkward in two player, we still had fun with it. We have created red lava on the green ground as an obstacle the smurf must jump over to avoid. One of the biggest defining characteristics of our game is that we created multiple screen where the smurf can continue to ‘explore’. When you go to the extreme right, we have another enemy shooting bullets out and the smurf must avoid those and jump on top of the enemy in order to collect another coin and kill quagmire. There is a levitating black box which can help our smurf achieve this, from that he goes on to collect the top most coin which opens up a portal. This portal appears and the orange and blue uva colored boxes then reveal the portal door from which we take smurf to the next screen over. To enter into the portal, the player simply walks into it. Here he must avoid another shooting enemy and  collect his coin. If you make it this far, the game is over. Features include an animated sprite, enemies, collectables, scrolling level, timer, health meter, and a two player mode. In addition, it has all of the required features (start screen, images, and user input).
